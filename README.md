# MATLAB-Earthquakes
Data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, patterns in data, and outliers. This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) application used to visualize earthquake data (.csv format), showing the location (latitude and longitude coordinates) as well as the magnitude of significant earthquakes around the world over a period of several decades.

## Key Features
- Input a desired year and get a detailed world map showing all significant earthquakes for that year, their location and their magnitude

- Interactive (zooming and panning) world map

- A 2D plot of the historical trend of earthquakes occurrences

- Works continuously without needing to re-launch application
